										<h3>11 May 2016</h3>

								        <p>The world is vast and beautiful and there is more to discover than what an entire lifetime can offer us. However, there are some countries you should definitely put on your bucket list because of what they offer. Here is our suggestion of top 10 countries to visit.</p>

										<p><strong>Australia</strong><br/>
										The land down under – famous for the Bondi beaches, kangaroos, the Great Barrier Reef and Sydney Opera House. It’s more than just a vast landscape – it’s a cosmopolitan country where you’ll find people from across the world, food to suit every taste bud and natural and man-made wonders that will leave you in awe.</p>

										<p>Every traveller will find something in Australia to keep them entertained – whether it’s an adventure in the Australian Outback, catching a wave on the Gold Coast or sightseeing in one of the many National Parks.</p>

										<p><strong>New Zealand</strong><br/>
										Better practice your Haka because that’s what the land of the All Blacks is known for! This small country sure packs a punch when it comes to keeping its visitors entertained. For one, the landscape and scenery is picturesque and will fill you with wonder. Here you’ll find lakes, mountains, glaciers and even volcanoes. </p>

										<p>Don’t think New Zealand is only for laid-back sightseeing holidays though. Go white water rafting in the Glaciers Region on the West Coast or perhaps black water rafting in the underground caves! On the West Coast you can also indulge in a full day of cave discovery. If you prefer the light of day, there are many hiking trails all over that will take you places no car can ever go.</p>

										<p><strong>Turkey</strong><br/>
										Get ready for an attack on your senses. Here colours, traffic, people, spices and coffee will take you on a whirlwind adventure. If you find yourself in Istanbul make sure to visit the Grand Bazaar, one of the largest and oldest, covered markets in the world. It covers 61 streets and has more than 30 000 shops – it’s any tourist and shopaholic’s dream!</p>

										<p>For a cultural experience don’t miss out on the Hagia Sophia and Blue Mosque. The architecture and history of these sites will astound you. Make sure to experience the natural wonder of Cappadocia with its popular “fairy chimneys”. Many tourists experience this magical landscape from a hot air balloon. After a long day of sight-seeing, eating and discovery head down to a bath house for a steam and a scrub – an ancient tradition you don’t want to miss out on!</p>

										<p><strong>Thailand</strong><br/>
										Picture-perfect white beaches with crystal clear waters…the beaches of Thailand are that which fairy tales are made of. Whether you go island hopping or stick to one spot, there is much to take in of this beautiful country.</p>

										<p>For those who enjoy a fresh culinary experience, head over to an eatery of choice and enjoy a seafood curry, a light soup, a Thai-flavoured omelette, sticky pork and rice, a green mango salad or one of the many rice-based desserts that you’ll find on the menu. With fresh fruit readily available everywhere this might be one holiday where you’re able to shed a few kilos!</p>

										<p><strong>Hungary</strong><br/>
										No longer is Budapest just a song that George Ezra sings about. Hungary, and especially Budapest, is quickly becoming one of the most popular tourist spots in Europe.</p>

										<p>For a touch of royalty, make sure to visit Buda Castle in Budapest. It has been likened to Versailles in Paris and with good reason. It is huge and rich in architecture and interior design. Other major attractions in Budapest include The Chain Bridge, Heroes Square and Andrassy Street. There are many operas and theatres to satisfy the cultural enthusiast. </p>

										<p>For indulgence of a different sort visit Lake Heviz and Heviz Spa. These natural hot pools are not only soothing to physical ailments but are sure to revive even the most tired traveller. </p>

										<p><strong>Italy</strong><br/>
										This shouldn’t come as any surprise. Italy has long since been one of Europe’s most-visited destinations in no small part thanks to the fact that it’s a historical and artistic dream. According to UNESCO Italy is home to 40% of all the art in the world! That is a staggering amount of riches that few other countries can even attempt to rival.</p>

										<p>However, the birthplace of the Renaissance has much to offer every tourist – whether you’re there for the art, the history, the romance, the food, the wine, the football or the countryside, Italy should be visited at least once. You’ll be sure to return again and again.</p>

										<p><strong>Spain</strong><br/>
										If Italy is the art capital of Europe and France is the romance hotspot, then Spain is the party capital! Just think of the vibrant nightlife of Ibiza, Granada and Madrid. There is no shortage of beautiful beaches, beautiful people and beautiful meals in the country that also brought us Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali, Penelope Cruz and Raphael Nadal.</p>

										<p>For those who want to experience some of the best beaches in Europe, head over to any of the beaches on Spain’s 5000 miles of coastline. Some of the favourites include Ibiza, Costa Del Sol, La Concha or the Canary Islands. Here you’ll be able to bask in the sun, go for leisurely strolls, tuck into some delicious Spanish street food (try the tapas and churros!) or have some fun in the water.</p>

										<p><strong>Brazil</strong><br/>
										Brazil will put a smile on your face, a song in your heart and get your feet moving. It’s a country of smiling people, festivals, great food, more than 2000 gorgeous beaches, spectacular natural beauty and a place where you can shop till you drop!</p>

										<p>Whether you prefer the laid back attractions like a ride on an Amazon River Steamer or getting active in Rio de Janeiro, the Brazilian people will make you feel at home and at ease. Don’t forget to try out the amazing selection of street food! Brigadeiros is Brazil’s answer to the chocolate truffle and a must-try. Acaraje is a black-eyed pea deep-fried patty stuffed with prawns, cashew nuts and other goodies. There is much more to discover but one thing that is sure, is that Brazil will leave you exhilarated!</p>

										<p><strong>The Bahamas</strong><br/>
										Idyllic beach scenes come to mind when you think of the Bahamas. Even from space one can observe the familiar turquoise coloured waters that have made this a firm-favourite with holiday-makers from all walks of life.</p>

										<p>Even though it’s long since been painted as the ultimate in romantic getaways, it’s also the perfect destination for families. Visit the Atlantis Paradise Island, a waterpark located on Paradise Island. Say “Ahoy Matey!” to The Pirates Museum and let your imagination run wild. Go fishing at Bimini Island which is well-known as the big game fishing capital of The Bahamas.</p>

										<p><strong>Canada</strong><br/>
										Step aside America, Canada made the list! For years Canada was not considered as a first choice in holiday destinations. However, the country that brings us maple syrup, ice hockey and the Niagra Falls is a gem when it comes to laid-back, country-inspired holidays.</p>

										<p>For one, the scenery will blow you away. It’s crisp, clear and untouched. Here you’ll be able to snowboard, kayak and sightsee to your hearts delight. Holidaying next to one of the gorgeous lakes promises to meet the satisfaction of even the most discerning traveller.</p>

										<p>Where will you go next or which countries are on your list of must-see places?</p>
