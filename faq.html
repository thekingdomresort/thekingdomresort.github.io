										<h3>The Resort</h3>
											<div id="accordion-container">
											    <h4 class="accordion-header">Who is developing The Kingdom Resort?</h4>
											    <div class="accordion-content">
											        <p>The Kingdom Resort is being developed by the Beekman Group. Having been in operation for more than 40 years, the Beekman Group has extensive experience in South Africa’s leisure and tourism sectors. The Kingdom Resort is one of four high-end resort developments that offer lifestyle and leisure property investment. All these resorts are grouped and marketed under the <a href="http://www.bmp.co.za" alt="Beekman Managed Portfolio" title="Beekman Managed Portfolio" target="_blank">Beekman Managed Portfolio (BMP)</a> brand. For more details on the Beekman Group visit their website at <a href="http://www.beekmangroup.com" alt="The Beekman Group" title="The Beekman Group" target="_blank">www.beekmangroup.com</a>.</p>
											    </div>
											    <h4 class="accordion-header">Who manages the day to day running of the resort?</h4>
											    <div class="accordion-content">
											    	<p>As an independent business entity within the Beekman Group, Vacation Management Services, the leading management company in the hospitality industry with over 30 years experience and over 26 resorts countrywide in their Management Portfolio, will be responsible for the day to day running of The Kingdom Resort.</p>

										<h3>Investors Club: Sectional Title Investment</h3>
											<div id="accordion-container">
											    <h4 class="accordion-header">How does Sectional Title Ownership work?</h4>
											    <div class="accordion-content">
											        <p>Sectional Title Ownership is a convenient way for individuals, businesses and syndicates to own and use a resort accommodation unit for up to 14 weeks annually. Sectional Title shares at a resort are typically purchased as a personal or corporate investment, which can be utilised each year either for holidays, staff incentive or capital returns purposes. Sectional Title Ownership of our resorts, whether as a complete unit or as an individual suite therein, is owned outright with each Owner possessing a title deed. You have access to up to 14 weeks of which up to 3 weeks may be in season. The remainder of the weeks will be rented out via BMP’s rental Pool to offer capital returns.</p>
											    </div>
											    <h4 class="accordion-header">What is The Kingdom Resort Investor Club?</h4>
											    <div class="accordion-content">
											    	<p>The Kingdom Resort Investor Club is the collective name used for all sectional title investments. Investors are able to purchase an entire Villa on a Sectional Title full Ownership basis. The spacious 3 or 4 bedroom Villas at one of our various developments offer unsurpassed luxury with a great rental return option. Alternatively, the Hotel Suites within the Villa can be purchased separately. As an Owner of one or more Sectional Title Hotel Suites, you get to enjoy all the benefits of normal Ownership without having to invest in a full Villa.</p>
											    </div>
											    <h4 class="accordion-header">What am I investing in?</h4>
											    <div class="accordion-content">
											    	<p>Each The Kingdom Resort Investor Club villa is divided into separate, luxurious suites (each with their own private access) and an entertainment area. Each of these suites, together with the entertainment area, comes with its own separate Title Deed. You can purchase a single suite, combined with the entertainment area or the entire villa. As a sectional title owner you get 14 weeks for your exclusive use and the balance is placed in a managed rental pool for you to earn rental returns against your investment.</p>
											    </div>
											    <h4 class="accordion-header">What is my usage time?</h4>
											    <div class="accordion-content">
											    	<p>Your usage time is the allocated period during which your holiday home is exclusively occupied by you. You get access to 14 weeks for personal use with your Sectional Ownership investment. Of the 14 personal weeks a maximum of three weeks may be reserved for in-season holiday periods. You can also put some of your 14 weeks into the rental pool to earn additional returns. Any of your unused weeks are automatically placed into the rental pool nine months before occupation if no occupation dates have been booked. This is to ensure optimal rental return.</p>
											    </div>
											    <h4 class="accordion-header">What fees do I pay?</h4>
											    <div class="accordion-content">
											    	<p>Each owner pays for the maintenance, cleaning and management costs in the form of an annual levy. Included in the annual budget is a provision allowance for a reserve fund, which is required to refurbish the villa on a 7 year cycle, so you can always be sure that the quality of your investment is maintained to a high standard.</p>

											    	<p>All owners who have purchased unit access time at The Kingdom Resort will pay an equal share of the monthly body corporate levy applicable to the unit owned. The levy is used for the property and administration costs of running and maintaining the resort to the standard that you expect.</p>
											    </div>
											</div><!-- end: Investors Club: Sectional Title Investment -->

										<h3>Private Residence Club: Fractional Ownership Investment</h3>
											<div id="accordion-container">
											    <h4 class="accordion-header">How does Fractional Title Ownership work?</h4>
											    <div class="accordion-content">
											        <p>Fractional Ownership can be defined as shared Ownership and shared usage of a professionally managed luxury holiday Villa. As the asset is owned by more than one individual, this means your capital investment, risk, and ongoing costs are drastically reduced. You get four weeks per year to access and the dates of the weeks vary each year. To ensure you are kept up to speed on what your dates are, please check the resort calendar on an annual basis.</p>
											    </div>
											    <h4 class="accordion-header">What is The Kingdom Resort Private Residence Club?</h4>
											    <div class="accordion-content">
											    	<p>The Kingdom Resort Private Residence Club is the collective name used for all fractional ownership investors. This is for Owners who want more than one week guaranteed holiday every year, but are not quite ready yet to purchase outright. Based on the Fractional Ownership model, the Private Residence Club allows you to purchase four weeks exclusive access to luxury self-catering holiday Villas at one of our various developments.</p>
											    </div>
											    <h4 class="accordion-header">What am I investing in?</h4>
											    <div class="accordion-content">
											    	<p>You are purchasing the right of exclusive occupancy (your "usage time") in a villa for a specific period. Your “share” of the villa in question is determined as two or four weeks ("time") depending on your purchase choice. During the weeks you have been allocated, the entire villa is at your disposal. The purchase price for each of the fractional periods available is determined by the seasonal demand for holiday accommodation at your resort.</p>
											    </div>
											    <h4 class="accordion-header">What is my usage time?</h4>
											    <div class="accordion-content">
											    	<p>Your usage time is the allocated period during which your holiday home is exclusively occupied by you. As a Fractional Title Owner you have two or four fixed weeks per year at your disposal with which to holiday at your chosen resort.</p>
											    </div>
											    <h4 class="accordion-header">What fees do I pay?</h4>
											    <div class="accordion-content">
											    	<p>Each owner pays for the maintenance, cleaning and management costs in the form of an annual levy. Included in the annual budget is a provision allowance for a reserve fund, which is required to refurbish the villa on a 7 year cycle, so you can always be sure that the quality of your investment is maintained to a high standard.</p>

											    	<p>All owners who have purchased unit access time at The Kingdom Resort will pay an equal share of the annual body corporate levy applicable to the unit owned. The levy is used for the property and administration costs of running and maintaining the resort to the standard that you expect. </p>
											    </div>
											    <h4 class="accordion-header">Can I transfer my Fractional Title Ownership?</h4>
											    <div class="accordion-content">
											    	<p>Should you wish to re-sell your Fractional Shares you can do so. Fractional Shares can also be passed on to family or friends through a simple transfer of shares process.</p>
											    </div>
											</div><!-- end: Private Residence Club: Fractional Ownership Investment -->

										<h3>Vacation Club: Timeshare Investment</h3>
											<div id="accordion-container">
											    <h4 class="accordion-header">How does Timeshare Ownership Work?</h4>
											    <div class="accordion-content">
											        <p>Ownership of a Timeshare week in the Vacation Club Chalets allows you to enjoy a guaranteed week long holiday in top class accommodation with full access to all resort facilities. The Ownership is broken into two typed namely Flexi Weeks and Fixed Weeks.</p>
											    </div>
											    <h4 class="accordion-header">What is The Kingdom Resort Vacation Club?</h4>
											    <div class="accordion-content">
											    	<p>The Kingdom Resort Vacation Club is the collective name used for all Timeshare Investors. For those who are more interested in Ownership for lifestyle and vacation time only, there are Timeshare weeks which are offered on both an express offering (12 year Ownership) or for life in perpetuity. Enjoy quality luxury holidays every year at affordable rates. All Vacation Club Chalets are fully self-catering and are serviced daily.</p>
